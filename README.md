## Disclaimer

Generative AI is experimental and, compared to classical software, less
controllable (probabilistic); for everything that requires exact data and
transactions, it is initially not suitable.

## The race and hype

![](static/screenshot-2025-05-19-161147-attention-is-all-you-need.png)

The paper that ignited the current LLM developments was published in 2017
(2017-06-12, 2899 days ago) and has as of 2025-05-19 180523 citations accroding
to [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Attention+is+all+you+need). On
average 62 citations of this paper per day.

If you sleep 8 hours a day and spend the rest of your day reading one paper per
hour (so 16 per day), you would spend the next **31 years** doing nothing that
reading research that would refer to this one paper alone.

## Current use cases

* [x] grammar checks, text critique ("human writing, machine feedback")
* [x] translations
* [x] generating code snippets, AI assisted software development
* [x] image editing (e.g. expand an image, remove artifacts)
* [x] brainstorming (e.g. for workshop themes)

We mostly do not generate images, nor raw text. We have enough images, and we
can and enjoy writing for our audience. Generated text can be shallow. More
code is not better, less code is better. We do not want to write more code than
we can read and understand.

## Current outreach

* meetups for [general public](https://www.ub.uni-leipzig.de/service/workshops-und-online-tutorials/schulungen/ki-stammtisch), and internal staff
* [workshops](https://www.ub.uni-leipzig.de/service/workshops-und-online-tutorials) for students, researchers

## Exploratory use cases

* [ ] optical character recognition (OCR)
* [ ] handwritten character recognition (HTR)
* [ ] metadata conversions utilities
* [ ] structured data extraction
* [ ] library as AI dataset curator

## Adjacent developments

* AI assisted search research tools and interfaces
* AI use of publishers, cf. [Publishers are selling papers to train AIs — and making millions of dollars](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04018-5), $10M, $23M, ...
* open weights models hosted by public institutions for general use
